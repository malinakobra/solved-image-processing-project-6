A robotic arm is implemented in fruit picking. Consider the color image, fruit on tree.tif below, (a) apply Otsu’soptimal global thresholding (single threshold) to R component, and (b) apply K-means clustering using T = 1, 5and 10 to the full-color image (RGB) to extract the plums (dividing into 2 clusters).Project #6assign December 21, 2020 due December 26, 2020Your report (Word or pdf format) should contain:• Source codes (30%)• Plot of the curve of between-class variance depending on all possible threshold values (20%)• Image of patterns extracted by Otsu’s algorithm (plotted in the same way as the color-slicing example shown below) (20%)• Images of patterns extracted by K-means clustering with different threshold values (plotted in the same way as the color&#x2;slicing example shown below) (30%)Note: Images must be plotted with good resolution.Upload your report to new e3 before due time!Note: You need to scale the intensitiesof the image to the range [0, 1] first!Original full&#x2;color imageMid-graytone
